# functions.Collections

In Kotlin, by default a collection is immutable. So you can't add or subtract values from
that collection once it's initially created.

## Arrays and List

The Difference between **arrayOf** and **listOf** is that Arrays have a fixed size while
List can adjust their size dynamically.
